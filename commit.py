#this page is use for writing commit messages
# This file is used to write commit messages for the changes made in the project.
# The commit messages should be clear and concise, describing the changes made in the code.
# The commit messages should follow the format:
# <type>(<scope>): <subject>
# where <type> is the type of change made (e.g., feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore),
# <scope> is the scope of the change (e.g., module, function, class),
# and <subject> is a brief description of the change made.
# For example:
# feat(hours_to_seconds): add calculation for seconds in given hours
# fix(future_age_calculator): correct future age calculation logic
# The commit messages should be written in the present tense and should not end with a period.
# The commit messages should be written in a way that makes it easy to understand the changes made in the code.
